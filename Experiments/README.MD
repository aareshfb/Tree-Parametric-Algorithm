This folder contains the code the python files used to run the experiments in the paper.

GenData.py         - This file is used to generate the matrix Q used for the experiments.
Run_Experiments.py - This file runs the experiments on synthetically generated Q,c,lam and saves the data in the Results folder.
Parametric.py      - This is main file that contains the code for the Parametric ALgorithm. The is the same file in the main (parent) folder of the repository.
Compare_SP.py      - This file runs the parametric algorithm and the direct dynamic programming algorithm on tridiagonal matrices and saves the reults from both experiments in Results folder.
