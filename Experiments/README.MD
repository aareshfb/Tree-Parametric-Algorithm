This folder contains the code the python files used to run the experiments in the paper.

accelerometer.csv  - This file contains the data used for the experiments on real world data

Compare_SP.py      - This file runs the parametric algorithm and the direct dynamic programming algorithm on tridiagonal matrices and saves the reults from both experiments in Results folder.

GenData.py         - This file is used to generate the matrix Q used for the experiments.

Parametric.py      - This is main file that contains the code for the Parametric ALgorithm. The is the same file in the main (parent) folder of the repository.

Run_Experiments.py - This file runs the experiments on synthetically generated Q,c,lam and saves the data in the Results folder.

SparseSignal.py    - This file runs the parametric algorithm on the real world dataset
